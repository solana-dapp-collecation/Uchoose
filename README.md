## ❓ About

**Uchoose** is a dApp that allows artists to create programmatically generated collections without writing any code.

Artists can initiate and upload the set of parameters which would be used for NFT generation in the collection.

Moreover, with the help of our dApp buyers control the appearance of the created NFT and release it by choosing its parameters from a set (the new NFT generated only after the purchase of the previous one in collection).
